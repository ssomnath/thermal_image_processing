Thermal Image Processing
=========================
**Suhas Somnath**

This simple standalone Igor-Po procedure file facilitates simple routines for processing results from AFM topography imaging using silicon self-heating AFM cantilevers. It was mainly used for purposes such as:

* Characterizing sensitivity and resolution for thermal topography imaging performed on standardized square grating samples
* Scaling voltage values to nanometers once the sensitivity and resolution were known
* Inverting images when images were acquiring using resistance control
* Adding an offset to all values in a channel - great for centering at 0 V
* Simple edge filtering
* Flipping the image vertically
* Clipping artifacts (spikes) in the signals that would occur at sharp vertical edges of gratings by coercing the values to lie within a min and max
* Replacing the contents of a layer with data present in a text file (relevant if the data of interest was acquired using an alternate source such as a National Instruments Data Acquisition system but if the user prefers to use Asylum Research's / Igor Pro for further image analysis)
* Deconvolving the shape of the cantilever heater from the measured image. See this paper for more information.
